/** THE JAVASCRIPT OBJECT **/

/* A Data Structure */

// Create an object to represent the pirate flag. Give it a name, color, and description of the image.


// Print the object to see its keys and values


/** ACCESSING OBJECT PROPERTIES */

/* Using a Key to Access a Value */

// Print the name using bracket notation

// Print the color using dot notation

// Print a template literal that describes the flag using all three properties â€” use a mix of bracket notation and dot notation



/** MODIFYING OBJECTS **/

/* Reassigning a Value to an Existing Key */

let blackPearl = {
	name: "Black Pearl",
	captain: "Jack Sparrow",
	crew: "pirates"
};

// Update the data when Barbossa and the crew mutiny and steal the gold

// Change the captain using dot notation

// Replace the crew using bracket notation

// Print the object to see the updated value


/* Adding a New Key-Value Pair to an Object */

let interceptor = {
	name: "Interceptor",
};

// After Jack and Will steal the ship from the Royal Navy and sail to Tortuga, the Interceptor has a new captain and crew.

// Use dot notation to add the new captain

// Use bracket notation to add a description of the new crew

// Print the object to see the new properties


/** OBJECT METHODS **/

/* Referencing an Existing Function */

function setSail() {
	console.log("Weigh anchor! Hoist the sails! Split-quick, you dibbies!");
}

// Add a property "sail" to the Interceptor, and assign the setSail function as a method 

// Print the ship object to show the new property

// Call the method on one of the ships
// NOTE: You MUST use DOT notation for calling methods

// What happens if you use the original function name instead of the key?


/* Defining an Anonymous Function */

let phrases = [
	"Wind in yer sails",
	"Dead men tell no tales",
	"Shiver me timbers",
	"Walk the plank",
	"Uh-oh. Fire in the hole!",
	"Any port in a storm"
];

// Create an object for Cotton's parrot with its owner's name, species and a method called "speak" which will print a random phrase from the array above


// Call the speak method three times



/* The this Keyword */

// Add a property called "describe" to the Black Pearl object and define an anonymous function that prints a description of the ship with its name, crew, and captain


// Print the object to see the new method

// Call the method


/** ITERATING THROUGH OBJECT KEYS **/

/* The for...in Loop */

let elizabeth = {
	firstName: "Elizabeth",
	lastName: "Swann",
	jewelry: "gold medallion",
	likes: ["Will Turner", "breathing"],
	dislikes: ["Captain Barbossa", "corsets"]
}

// Use a for...in loop to print the keys and values together in a template literal
// NOTE: you MUST use bracket notation when the key is a variable



/** OBJECTS STORING OTHER DATA STRUCTURES **/

/* Objects Storing Arrays */

// Print each of Elizabeth's likes and dislikes
// Assume the two arrays have the same length



/* Objects Storing Objects */

let barbossa = {
	name: "Hector Barbossa",
	ship: "The Black Pearl",
	pet: {
		name: "Jack",
		species: "capuchin monkey"
	}
}

// Print the monkey's name

// Loop through Barbossa's pet's keys and print both values



/** WORKING WITH AN ARRAY OF OBJECTS **/

let gibbs = {
	name: "Joshamee Gibbs",
	position: "first mate"
}
let anamaria = {
	name: "Anamaria",
	position: "sailor"
}
let cotton = {
	name: "Cotton",
	position: "sailor"
}
let ragetti = {
	name: "Ragetti",
	position: "sailor"
}

// Store all four crew members in an array

// Print the new array

// Print the names and positions of all members in motleyCrew
