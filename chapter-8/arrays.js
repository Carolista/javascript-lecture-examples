/** CREATING ARRAYS & BRACKET NOTATION **/

let enemies = ["Daleks", "Cybermen", "the ones in the library", "Weeping Angels"];

// Use bracket notation to print the second element of the array. Remember that arrays are zero-indexed!


// Unlike strings, arrays ARE mutable â€” use bracket notation to replace the third element with the correct name, then print the entire array.


// Use bracket notation to add a new element to the array, the print the array. Calculate the next available index instead of hard-coding it


// Create an empty array, then use bracket notation to add the names of some of the Doctor's allies, then print the array.


// Try printing an element of allies at index 10. What happens?



/** THE LENGTH PROPERTY **/

// Print the length of the array of allies.


// Use the length to calculate the index of the last element of the array of enemies, and print that element.



/** COMMON ARRAY METHODS **/

/* Locate an Element within an Array */

// Check to see if Kate Stewart is in the array of allies and print the result (true or false).


// Find the index of the Weeping Angels in the enemies array and print it



/* Create by Concatenating Multiple Arrays */

let companions10 = ["Rose", "Martha", "Donna"];
let companions11 = ["Amy", "Rory"];
let companions12 = ["Clara", "Bill", "Nardole"];
let companions13 = ["Ryan", "Graham", "Yasmin"];

// Combine the three arrays into a single array and print it.



/* Create by Taking a Slice */

// Create a new array from just the middle 3 of the list of companions, then print it.



/* Create by Splitting a String */

let judoonJS = "JO BLO VO BLO SO CO RO KRO PO TO";

// Create a new array with each Judoon letter as a separate element, then print it


/* Joining an Array To Create a String */

// Print the Judoon word as a string again, this time connected by something other than just a space



/* Reverse */

// Reverse the array with all enemies and print it



/* Sort */

// Sort the companion list array alphabetically and print it.



/* Add & Remove at End of Array */

// Declare a variable to store the result when you remove the last element from the array of allies. Print the variable, then print the modified array.


// Add the name back to the end of the array, then print the modified array.



/* Add & Remove at Beginning of Array */

// Declare a variable to store the result when you remove the first element from the list of enemies. Print the variable, then print the modified array.


// Add the removed element back to the beginning of the array, then print the modified array.


/* Insert and/or Remove Anywhere in an Array */

// Remove Harriet Jones from the allies array, then print the modified array.


// Add Wilfred Mott to the list of allies, somewhere in the middle.



/** METHOD CHAINING **/

let tardis = "tardis";

// In a single line of code, change "tardis" to "T.A.R.D.I.S", then print the reassigned variable.
// Steps, which may not be in the right order:
//  split string into an array of characters
//  make all characters uppercase
//  join characters with periods


// Starting with the array of enemies, print a single string that lists the enemies in reverse alphabetical order, each separated by a comma and space.
// Steps, which must be done in a certain order:
//  While it is an array, sort it, then reverse it
//  Then join with the connector ", " to make it a string


/** MULTIDIMENSIONAL ARRAYS **/

// Put all four arrays of companions inside a single array, then print it


// Print Donna's name using bracket notation with allCompanions


// Print Clara's name using bracket notation with allCompanions
