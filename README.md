Lecture examples for Unit 1 of LaunchCode's WebDev Course

Students — to code along with my [lecture recordings on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@CodeWithCarrie) use the `main` branch for starter code. You may reference the `solution` branch if you get stuck.

Because this is a work in progress, you may occasionally need to merge in changes from my repo to your forked copy. Follow the instructions [here](https://education.launchcode.org/intro-to-web-dev-curriculum/how-programs-work/reading/your-first-program/index.html#handling-changes-to-the-original-repo) to do that whenever necessary.

NOTE:
All code in this repo was added beginning in October 2023 with the switch to the [new curriculum](https://education.launchcode.org/intro-to-web-dev-curriculum/) and it may not be consistent with older lectures based in the [old curriculum](https://education.launchcode.org/intro-to-professional-web-dev/index.html) when Replit was still in use.
