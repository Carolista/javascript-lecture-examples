Lecture examples for Unit 1 of LaunchCode's WebDev Course

Students — to code along with my [lecture recordings on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@CodeWithCarrie) use the `main` branch for starter code. You may check the `solution` branch if you get stuck. 

Currently all code in this branch is being added during October-December 2023 with the switch to the [new curriculum](https://education.launchcode.org/intro-to-web-dev-curriculum/) and it may not be consistent with older lectures based in the [old curriculum](https://education.launchcode.org/intro-to-professional-web-dev/index.html) when Replit was still in use.
