/** The Beverage Class **/

/*
	TODO: Define a Beverage class and give the constructor three parameters: name, ounces, and container, then set the properties accordingly.

  Add one more property (not params) called recycled and set it to false.

  Add a method called recycle() that sets the recycled property to true and prints a sentence with the name and container as a confirmation.

	Add a method called describe() that prints a sentence to the console with its name, container, and capacity. The sentence should differ slightly depending on whether it's been recycled or not.
